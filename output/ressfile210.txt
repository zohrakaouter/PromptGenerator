Modify the `Discovery` class to remove the `maxUsedMemoryInBytes` attribute.2. Create the `DiscoveryIteration` class and add the `maxUsedMemoryInBytes` attribute to it.3. Update the `Discovery` class to have a list of `DiscoveryIteration` objects as a reference called `iterations`.4. Modify the `getIterations` method in the `Discovery` class to return the `iterations` list.5. Update the `rescaleDebugCode` method call to access the `maxUsedMemoryInBytes` attribute through the `iterations` list.The coevolved code would look like this:```pythonclass Discovery:    def __init__(self):        self.iterations = []    def getIterations(self):        return self.iterationsclass DiscoveryIteration:    def __init__(self):        self.maxUsedMemoryInBytes = 0def rescaleDebugCode(memory):    # Rescale debug code based on the memory value    pass# Example usagediscovery = Discovery()iteration = DiscoveryIteration()iteration.maxUsedMemoryInBytes = 512discovery.iterations.append(iteration)# Updated code using getIterations methodfor d_iter in discovery.getIterations():    rescaleDebugCode(d_iter.maxUsedMemoryInBytes)```Note: In this example I assumed that the `rescaleDebugCode` method is responsible for handling the scaling or rescaling of some debug code based on the memory value. You would need to implement the logic inside the `rescaleDebugCode` method according to your requirements.

First rename the attribute `discoveryError` to `discoveryErrors` in the class where it is defined.2. Next generate the `setDiscoveryErrors` method in the class to update the `discoveryErrors` attribute.Here's an example of how the code would look after coevolving it:```pythonclass Discovery:    def __init__(self):        self.discoveryErrors = None  # Initialize discoveryErrors attribute    def setDiscoveryErrors(self errors):        self.discoveryErrors = errors  # Update the discoveryErrors attribute# Usage:error = "Some error message"discovery = Discovery()discovery.setDiscoveryErrors(error)```Now you can use the `setDiscoveryErrors` method to update the `discoveryErrors` attribute in the `Discovery` class.

Here's the updated code:```python# Old code# discovery.setMaxUsedMemoryInBytes(totalMemory)# New codeiterations = discovery.setIterations()for iteration in iterations:    iteration.setMaxUsedMemoryInBytes(totalMemory)```In the new code we first call the `setIterations()` method of the `Discovery` class which returns a list of `DiscoveryIteration` objects. Then we iterate over each `DiscoveryIteration` object in the list and call the `setMaxUsedMemoryInBytes()` method passing the `totalMemory` value as an argument. This way the `maxUsedMemoryInBytes` attribute is set in each `DiscoveryIteration` object.
