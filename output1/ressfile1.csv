11,Extract property,Error : getMaxUsedMemoryInBytes Line : 207,The attribute maxUsedMemoryInBytes is moved from the class Discovery to the class DiscoveryIteration through the reference iterations Considering that calling getIterations from the class Discovery returns a list of DiscoveryIterationobjects Coevolve this code : rescaleDebugCode(discovery.getMaxUsedMemoryInBytes()),To coevolve the code we need to update it to use the `DiscoveryIteration` class and its reference `iterations`. Here's the updated code:```pythonfor iteration in discovery.getIterations():    rescaleDebugCode(iteration.getMaxUsedMemoryInBytes())```In this updated code we iterate over the `iterations` list returned by `getIterations()` method of the `Discovery` class. For each `DiscoveryIteration` object in the list we call the `getMaxUsedMemoryInBytes()` method to get the maximum used memory in bytes and pass it to the `rescaleDebugCode()` function.
