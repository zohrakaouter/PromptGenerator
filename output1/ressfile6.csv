16,Extract property,Error : getMaxUsedMemoryInBytes Line : 207,The attribute maxUsedMemoryInBytes is moved from the class Discovery to the class DiscoveryIteration through the reference iterations Considering that calling getIterations from the class Discovery returns a list of DiscoveryIterationobjects Coevolve this code : rescaleDebugCode(discovery.getMaxUsedMemoryInBytes()),To coevolve the code you would need to update the method call `rescaleDebugCode(discovery.getMaxUsedMemoryInBytes())` to use the `getIterations` method from the `Discovery` class. Here's the updated code:```pythoniterations = discovery.getIterations()maxUsedMemoryInBytes = iterations[-1].getMaxUsedMemoryInBytes()rescaleDebugCode(maxUsedMemoryInBytes)```In this code we first get the list of `DiscoveryIteration` objects by calling `discovery.getIterations()`. Since the `getIterations` method returns a list we can access the last iteration by using `iterations[-1]`. Then we retrieve the `maxUsedMemoryInBytes` attribute from that iteration object. Finally we pass the `maxUsedMemoryInBytes` value to the `rescaleDebugCode` method.
