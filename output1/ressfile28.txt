18,Extract property,Error : getMaxUsedMemoryInBytes Line : 207,The attribute maxUsedMemoryInBytes is moved from the class Discovery to the class DiscoveryIteration through the reference iterations Considering that calling getIterations from the class Discovery returns a list of DiscoveryIterationobjects Coevolve this code : rescaleDebugCode(discovery.getMaxUsedMemoryInBytes()),To coevolve the code you need to modify the `rescaleDebugCode` method to accept a list of `DiscoveryIteration` objects instead of a single `Discovery` object. Then you can iterate over the list and retrieve the `maxUsedMemoryInBytes` attribute from each `DiscoveryIteration` object.Here's the coevolved code:```pythondef rescaleDebugCode(iterations):    for iteration in iterations:        max_used_memory = iteration.getMaxUsedMemoryInBytes()        # Perform rescaling debug code using max_used_memory        # ...```Now when you call `rescaleDebugCode(discovery.getIterations())` it will iterate over the list of `DiscoveryIteration` objects and retrieve the `maxUsedMemoryInBytes` attribute from each object.

58,Delete property,Error : getMetaModelVariant Line : 240,The attribute metaModelVariant is deleted from the class Discovery  the method getMetaModelVariant is generated and its usage must be deleted Coevolve this code : diagramTitle+=discovery.getMetaModelVariant() + " "  If there is any instruction to delete please comment it with significant message,To coevolve the code and delete the usage of the method `getMetaModelVariant()` you can follow these steps:1. Remove the attribute `metaModelVariant` from the class `Discovery`. This can be done by deleting the corresponding variable declaration and any related code that uses or modifies this attribute.2. Generate the method `getMetaModelVariant()` in the class `Discovery`. This method should return the value of the `metaModelVariant` attribute. Make sure to implement the method according to the desired behavior.3. Search for the usage of the method `getMetaModelVariant()` in the codebase. In this case you need to find the line `diagramTitle+=discovery.getMetaModelVariant() + " "`.4. Delete the line `diagramTitle+=discovery.getMetaModelVariant() + " "`. This line concatenates the value returned by `getMetaModelVariant()` with the existing `diagramTitle` string. Since the method is no longer needed this line becomes unnecessary and can be safely removed.By following these steps you will successfully coevolve the code and remove the usage of the method `getMetaModelVariant()`.
