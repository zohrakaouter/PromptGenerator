19,Delete Class ,Error : createProjectDiscovery Line : 163,The metaclass ProjectDiscovery is deleted   the method createProjectDiscovery is generated and its usage must be deleted Coevolve this code : ProjectDiscovery projectDiscovery=BenchmarkFactory.eINSTANCE.createProjectDiscovery()  If there is any instruction to delete please comment it with significant message,To coevolve the code you can follow these steps:1. Delete the metaclass `ProjectDiscovery` and any references to it in the codebase.2. Delete the method `createProjectDiscovery` and any calls to it.3. Replace the line `ProjectDiscovery projectDiscovery=BenchmarkFactory.eINSTANCE.createProjectDiscovery()` with an alternative code that achieves the same functionality. Since the metaclass `ProjectDiscovery` is deleted you will need to find an alternative way to create an instance of a similar class or object. Without further context it is difficult to provide a specific alternative code. However you can consider the following general approach:a. Identify the purpose of the `ProjectDiscovery` class and its attributes/methods.b. Look for other classes or objects in the codebase that serve a similar purpose or have similar attributes/methods.c. Instantiate the alternative class or object using the appropriate method or constructor.d. Modify any subsequent code that relies on the `ProjectDiscovery` instance to use the alternative class or object instead.Remember to thoroughly test the coevolved code to ensure it functions as expected.
