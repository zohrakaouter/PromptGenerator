However based on the given information if the metaclass `MultiProjectBenchmark` is deleted it is likely that the class `MultiProjectBenchmark` and any associated elements generated from it will also be deleted.Therefore if the metaclass `MultiProjectBenchmark` is deleted the code snippet `MultiProjectBenchmark benchmark=buildReportModelAndDiagrams()` would need to be modified or removed accordingly. Without further information it is not possible to provide a specific coevolution suggestion.

144,Extract property,Error : setMaxUsedMemoryInBytes Line : 187,The attribute maxUsedMemoryInBytes is moved from the class Discovery to the class DiscoveryIteration through the reference iterations Considering that calling setIterations from the class Discovery returns a list of DiscoveryIterationobjects Coevolve this code : discovery.setMaxUsedMemoryInBytes(maxUsedMemory),In order to coevolve the code we need to make the following changes:1. Add the attribute `maxUsedMemoryInBytes` to the class `DiscoveryIteration`:```pythonclass DiscoveryIteration:    def __init__(self):        self.maxUsedMemoryInBytes = 0```2. Modify the `setIterations` method in the `Discovery` class to return a list of `DiscoveryIteration` objects:```pythonclass Discovery:    def setIterations(self):        iterations = []        # Add code to create and populate the iterations list        return iterations```3. Update the `setMaxUsedMemoryInBytes` method in the `Discovery` class to set the `maxUsedMemoryInBytes` attribute of the `DiscoveryIteration` objects:```pythonclass Discovery:    def setMaxUsedMemoryInBytes(self maxUsedMemory):        iterations = self.setIterations()        for iteration in iterations:            iteration.maxUsedMemoryInBytes = maxUsedMemory```Now when calling `discovery.setMaxUsedMemoryInBytes(maxUsedMemory)` the `maxUsedMemoryInBytes` attribute will be set for each `DiscoveryIteration` object in the list returned by `setIterations` method.
