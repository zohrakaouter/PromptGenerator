However based on the given information if the metaclass `MultiProjectBenchmark` is deleted it is likely that the class `MultiProjectBenchmark` and any associated elements generated from it will also be deleted.Therefore if the metaclass `MultiProjectBenchmark` is deleted the code snippet `MultiProjectBenchmark benchmark=buildReportModelAndDiagrams()` would need to be modified or removed accordingly. Without further information it is not possible to provide a specific coevolution suggestion.
